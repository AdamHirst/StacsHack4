GoHack is a hackathon travel planner which collates hackathons from various sources and finds the cheapest flights from your location.

## Features
- Finds hackathons from various sources, including Major League Hacking (MLH) and hackathons.com
- Displays flight prices from the user's current location
- Allows users to easily purchase flights from a single click

## Future development
- Currently we only use cached flight searches. In future, we should be able to handle stops per route by using an alternative API.
